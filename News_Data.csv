NKE,"Nike to cut China reliance to ease tariff hit, sending shares soaring","STORY: Nike missed one goal this week.It tried to help Kenyan runner Faith Kipyegon become the first woman to run a sub four-minute mile.In the end, she fell just short, but still set an unofficial new record.Off the track, the sportswear giant has a very different race to run.It’s trying to beat the impact of Donald Trump’s sweeping global tariffs.On Thursday the company said it would reduce its reliance on China for manufacturing goods it sells in the U.S. as part of the strategy.China currently accounts for about 16% of the shoes it imports to the United States.And Nike aims to cut that to the “high single-digits” range by the end of May next year.Investors welcomed the news, sending Nike shares soaring 11% in after-hours trade.Also helping sentiment were forecast-beating results for the latest period.Fourth-quarter sales sank 12%, but analysts had expected even worse.China is the pain point there too, with executives saying a turnaround in the country will take time amid a weak economy and mounting competition.The company is now a bit more optimistic than analysts about the coming period, however.It predicts sales will see a percentage fall in the mid single-digits, or less than Wall Street has forecast.Analysts say running shoes are doing well for Nike, making up for expected declines in the sales of regular sneakers.",2025-06-26 20:30:21,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=b88b5ab980f414f51668b0be41228d681efbbba4d8d1ac3f99b4e202b5977b52

TSLA,"Xiaomi shares hit record as EV orders soar, raising pressure on Tesla","STORY: The pressure just keeps mounting for Tesla in China.Friday saw local rival Xiaomi announce exceptionally strong orders for its new YU7 electric vehicle.The car is aimed squarely at Tesla’s Model Y, and undercuts it on price.Analysts say it also comprehensively beats the U.S. vehicle on specs and performance.Xiaomi says it secured 289,000 orders in the car’s first hour on sale.That was more than three times the level its first car model last year - the SU7 sedan - and almost triple market expectations.Analysts say Tesla’s Model Y will probably lose market share in China as a result.That would rub salt in the wound for the U.S. firm, which has been steadily losing ground to Chinese rivals.Its share of the EV market there has fallen from 15% in 2020, to about half that level over the first few months of this year.Xiaomi’s SU7, for one, has outsold Tesla’s competing Model 3 every month since December.Analysts at Citi say Elon Musk’s company may have no choice but to cut prices in response.They say it may also have to offer its so-called “Full Self Driving” system for free, instead of as a charged option.Tesla didn’t respond to a request for comment on its plans.Xiaomi shares shot 8% higher on Friday’s news, hitting a record high.Though they later pared some of those gains, the stock has still more than tripled over the past year.That values the firm - until recently better known for its smartphones - at nearly $200 billion.",2025-06-26 23:43:09,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=7c3271b17c4ee1233fcfef484571373432f42e8df5affedc00783107f91151ff

AMZN,Price rises for Chinese goods outpacing inflation on US Amazon: study,"STORY: Prices for goods made in China and sold on Amazon in the U.S. are rising faster than inflation.That’s according to a study done for Reuters by analytics firm DataWeave.It shows that the median price for a basket of such goods rose 2.6% between January and mid-June.Over roughly the same period, the core consumer prices index rose at an annualized rate of about 2%.DataWeave focused on 1,407 items sold on Amazon, where China is clearly listed as the country of origin.Products rising in price at the fastest pace included school and office supplies, electronic items like printers, and home goods like furnishings and cookware.The increase naturally varied from product to product, with some even seeing decreases.While other factors could be at play, DataWeave says the timing of the increases suggest a ripple effect from new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods.Its analysis comes after numerous U.S. retailers warned of price hikes as a result of the trade war.That includes Walmart and department store chain Macy’s, as well as sportswear giant Nike.However, Amazon said it had not detected any big increase in average prices over the period of the study.Boss Andy Jassy said in May that the firm was “maniacally focused” on avoiding increases.Earlier in the year,  the U.S. hit Chinese goods with tariffs of 145%, though the new levies have since been rolled back to 30%.Donald Trump has defended the move as necessary to rebalance global trade.",2025-06-30 23:31:10,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=970f83251866ad1a58048478bc99e8a0600788e0c546f7b03fdc656d22d91533
